Add scraper weights and LLM score transparency

Implements a weighted scoring system for LLM-based candidate selection
with full transparency into scoring decisions.

Features:
- Scraper weights as tiebreaker when LLM scores are similar (within 0.1)
- LubimyCzytac favored with highest weight (3.0) for best Polish metadata
- Display all LLM scores and applied weights to user before confirmation
- Only applies weights to candidates in same quality bracket
- Preserves LLM score primacy for clear winners

Changes:
- src/config.py: Added 'weight' field to SCRAPER_REGISTRY
  * lubimyczytac: 3.0 (highest - most favored)
  * audible: 2.0 (medium)
  * goodreads: 1.5 (lowest)

- src/search/candidate_selection.py:
  * Added last_scored_candidates storage for display
  * Added _apply_scraper_weights() method
  * Updated _ai_select_candidate() to apply weights and store scores
  * Weight formula: final_score = llm_score * (1.0 + (weight - 1.0) * 0.1)

- src/search/auto_search.py:
  * Enhanced AI selection display to show all LLM scores
  * Shows weighted scores when weights were applied
  * Clear marker for selected candidate
  * Displays title of selected candidate for context
