# :book: BadaBoomBooks :bomb:

Quickly organize audiobooks using a terminal and web-browser


# Dependencies
* A web-browser
* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`


# Description
The inconsistencies between audiobooks don't make for reliable matches using fully-automated solutions. This program is a semi-automatic process, that way you can be sure your books are matched properly, while only taking a couple clicks and a few seconds per book.

After calling the script and passing it audiobook folders, it will read the ID3 tags of your audiobook and make a websearch for `{title} by {author}` in your web browser. If the tags are blank it'll fallback to the folder name.

All you need to do is select the correct web-page, copy the URL, and the folder will be added to the queue. The whole process usually only takes a few seconds per book.

Once every folder you passed has been added to the queue, the organization will begin, at which point no further user-input is required. By default, folders are outputted to `./_BadaBoomBooks_/` in the same directory as the input folder, this way you can keep track of which ones you've already processed.

# Examples

### - Basic -

This is is the most basic usage, only folders are renamed, filenames will be unnaffected. For first-timers, I recommend running this on a copy of your audiobook to see how it works.

ℹ️ Rename (move) audiobook folders to  `{author}/{title}` structure

`$ python ./BadaBoomBooks.py '/Path/to/Audiobook-1/' '/Path/to/Audiobook-2/' ...`

### - AudioBookShelf (Recommended) -
The ASIN from Audible will be saved to a `metadata.opf` file, which AudioBookShelf will read during a library scan. Using that ASIN number, AudioBookShelf will be able to perform a perfect quick-match, which means you'll have the exact metadata corresponding to this book. The `info.txt` file is used by SmartAudioBookPlayer to display a summary, doesn't cost us anything to include it.

ℹ️ Flatten folders, rename files to `{author}/{title}/## - {title}`, generate `metadata.opf`, and generate `info.txt`.

`$python ./BadaBoomBooks.py -f -r -o -i '/Path/to/Audiobook-1/' '/Path/to/Audiobook-2/' ...`


# Tips
* The default behaviour is to RENAME the audiobook folders, pass the `-c` flag to copy instead.
* The process is smoother if you keep the terminal and browser side-by-side.
* Break large jobs into smaller batches, that way if the program runs into issues you haven't lost too much effort.
* Linux Users: If you're have issues with clipboard detection, refer to the [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) page for a possible solution.

----------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS --------------------------------------

1) Call the script and pass it the audiobook folders you would like to process, including any optional arguments...
    python BadaBoomBooks.py "C:\Path\To\Audiobook_folder1" "C:\Path\To\Audiobook_folder2" ...
    python BadaBoomBooks.py -s audible -c -o -i "C:\Path\To\Audiobook_folder1" "C:\Path\To\Audiobook_folder2" ...

2) Your browser will open and perform a web search for the current book, simply select the correct web-page and copy the url to your clipboard.

3) After building the queue, the process will start and folders will be organized accordingly. Cheers!
